                  inherent features related to engaging in recording the data on
                  the blockchain. Interactions with the Lens Protocol rely on
                  smart contracts stored on a publicly available blockchain,
                  cryptographic tokens generated by the smart contracts, and
                  other nascent software, applications and systems that interact
                  with blockchain-based networks. One of the defining features
                  of blockchain technology is that its entries are immutable,
                  which means, as a technical matter, they generally cannot be
                  deleted or modified by anyone. If you are not comfortable
                  assuming the inherently immutable and public nature of all
                  entries on the blockchain, you should not engage with our
                  Site.
